          <h2>From Accountant To iOS Developer: My Experience</h2>
<p class="meta">12 Mar 2014</p>

<div class="post start_page">
<p>I worked as an accountant for three years after I graduated from a school that is famous for business and accounting in China. Even though my income was enough to live a decent life in China, I was never happy with my work. Every day I would wake up asking myself &quot;what am I doing? Is it how my life would be like for the next ten or twenty years?&quot;</p>

<p>Then two years later I quit my job. I couldn&#39;t stand it anymore. It was no surprise that my parents and friends were shocked. I travelled, read for a year for nothing. Then someday when my savings were coming to zero, I had to take another job as an financial management staff in a big corporate.</p>

<p>Almost one year later I was totally desperate. Every single day I counted my minutes at work, and couldn&#39;t sleep at night because I couldn&#39;t even face the reality that I was going to work again the next day.</p>

<p>However, I was doing an excellent job as a financial staff. My manager did have high expectations for me. But the better I was doing my job, the worse I felt. It was like that you knew you were sailing in a wrong direction, but the sail boat just could&#39;nt stop moving faster.</p>

<p>I visited Quora every time I felt I couldn&#39;t breathe. And then I jumped into the water.</p>

<p>Another door opened underwater. I learned a lot from great people like Oliver Emberton in Quora (People Who Help Me Make Career Decision), and I read those essays again and again.</p>

<p>At the same time I started to study Objective-C and iOS development because I was interested in coding. I had a little coding experience, only sufficient enough for building my own website. So then I started building stuff like <a href="https://www.quora.com/Oliver-Emberton">Oliver Embertonhad</a> suggested ( <a href="https://www.quora.com/Career-Advice/At-age-25-would-you-pursue-a-good-paying-corporate-job-that-makes-you-unhappy-or-a-hobby-that-makes-you-happy-but-has-no-guarantee-to-pay-the-bills/answer/Oliver-Emberton">Oliver Emberton&#39;s answer to Career Advice: At age 25, would you pursue a good paying corporate job that makes you unhappy or a hobby that makes you happy but has no guarantee to pay the bills?</a>). The hours after work and weekends were spent coding. This went for almost a year.</p>

<p>Then one day when I was able to build my own app and had saved up enough money to support myself for a few months, I quit my job again. I worked on my own apps for about four months. The city library was my new home. I also built my personal blog to demonstrate my expertise in coding (<a href="http://www.haojianzong.com">JianZong</a>). Then as soon as I had built some demo apps, I applied for iOS development occupations online. Luckily, I only interviewed for one company and I got a job.</p>

<p>Though my salary is a little shorter compared with my financial job, I am much happier now. Everyday is a new challenge, and I have a lot of fun stuff for me to learn. I am now eager to learn new technology and enjoy building different stuff at work.</p>
