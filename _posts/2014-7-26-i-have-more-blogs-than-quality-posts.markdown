I have more blogs than posts

As a software developer, it is important for my voice to be heard. My potential employer and clients are very likely to look for my posts on the internet before they decide to approach me.

Therefore, I have been struggling to write blogs for almost 4 years. But honestly, I barely contributed anything to the digital world.

Seriously, what am I going to blog about back when I was an accountant? Every time when I decided to write something, I started to try to make a new theme for my rusted Wordpress blog. Then I spent almost a whole saturday afternoon coding HTML/CSS just to make my blog look a little bit cooler. But I forgot to write anything. Every time.

Enough, I said.

…before this saturday afternoon. 

It started like this. After this afternoon break, when I was wondering what I should do with my life, I opened my worpress blog (for chinese posts). Then I opened my Ghost blog (for english posts) in a new tab. Then I opened my another Jekyll blog (for english posts too) in a new tab. Then I opened my Medium account in a new tab. Then I opened my zhihu ( a Quora equivalent in china) blog in a new tab. There are 4 blogs of mine before I found out there is a Quora blog.

Seriously??I haven’t written anything useful but I have 5 blogs?

Just in memoir of my time wasted on setting up these blogs, I must write something about these blog platforms.

1.Wordpress

I have been using Wordpress for at least 5 years. Wordpress is super powerful in setting up all kind of websties, but it is notorious for being slow and buggy. It is not as easy to install as it claimed either. If you are not familiar with setting up hostings and domains, then good luck. However, alternatively, you can use the service of WordPress.com, which will do most of the work for you.

2.Ghost 

As a newly born blog platform, ghost is fast and elegant as first glance. I must say that the editing area of ghost is well designed. But it is complicated to host a ghost blog. I spend an afternoon hosting one on the AWS EC2. As elegant as ghost is, I doubt why people will chose to blog with ghost when there is medium.

3.Medium

Fast, simple, fun and easy to use. And you get the benefits of blogging together with others. Medium is my first choice of telling stories.

4.Jekyll

Super fast because it generates static pages, but not easy to use if you are not familiar with Git.

5.Quora Blog

I am not familiar with the Quora blog, but I love Quora, why not give it a try? The audience on Quroa are great.

I’d better start writing somequality posts.
