TDD: the definition
===================
*Wikipedia*
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on
the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes
an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement
or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test,
and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

*agileskillsproject.org*
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a way of driving the design of code by
writing a test which expresses what you intend the code to do, making that
test pass, and continuously refactoring to keep the design as simple as
possible. TDD can apply at multiple levels, e.g., Customer Tests, Integration
Tests, Unit Tests.
Test-Driven Development/Design follows a rigorous cycle. Start by writing a
failing test (Red.) Implement the simplest solution that will cause the test
to pass (Green.) Search for duplication and remove it (Refactor.)
"RED-GREEN-REFACTOR" has become almost a mantra for many TDD practitioners.
Understanding and even internalizing this cycle is key to being able to use
TDD to solve problems.
