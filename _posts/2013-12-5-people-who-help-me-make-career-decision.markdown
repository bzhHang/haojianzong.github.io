Career transition is as difficult. I stumbled my way from accountant to programmer.

I learned a lot from great people on the Internet. Following are a few articles I read again and again:

1. [\<How to do what you love\>](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html) - Essay by Paul Graham
Paul Graham talks about why work can be fun and how can you might find one you
love.

2. [Oliver Emberton](http://oliveremberton.com) from Quora writes about understanding and getting the most from life, some of his writings that help me a lot:
  * [\<Closing Gaps\>](http://www.quora.com/Career-Advice/At-age-25-would-you-pursue-a-good-paying-corporate-job-that-makes-you-unhappy-or-a-hobby-that-makes-you-happy-but-has-no-guarantee-to-pay-the-bills/answer/Oliver-Emberton), he writes about why we should stop making scary big decisions and start closing gaps between our desires and your current
  situation.
  * [\<How to master your time\>](http://oliveremberton.com/2013/how-to-master-your-time/) And many of his best articles here.

3. [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)
