This days I moved to a new house, read a fews pages of < Code Complete >.
Surprisingly, I find coding and house keeping shared a lot in common.

Write as few code as possible, one thing I learned in Code Complete. If you
write abundant codes, they will grow widely as time passes. If I buy more
and more furnitures for my house, I have to spend more money/time on
cleaning, organizing and moving.

Coders keep saying that naming variables is the major task of they daily
job. I thought it was a joke.

But I now know that it isn't. Naming variables is the key process of
abstracting the real world.

As said in Code Complete, the primary permitive of coding is reducing complexity. Well named classes, methods and variables help us to form good abstraction from what we are building. And abstraction is important.

So, to improve my code quality, I am trying to code less and think more.
