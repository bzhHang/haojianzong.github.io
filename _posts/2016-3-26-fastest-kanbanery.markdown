After reading a lot of productivity methods, I recently fell in love with using Kanbanery to manage my daily tasks.

It happens so often that during the day at some random minute, an idea pop up in my mind. At that moment I deseperately want to quickly add a task to my Kanbanery task.

The fastest way to create a task in Kanbanery comes from a combination of Launch Center (an iPhone app) and Kanbanery email task creation.

So here are the steps to setup:

First, find your Project Email according [this official tips][1].

Second, create an in-app email shortcut using Launch Center. As shown below, I create two shortcuts. One to plain text task, the other to send a task with photo.

In this way, whenever an idea come up in my mind, I will be able to grap my
iPhone and add a task to my Kanbanery inbox instantly.
