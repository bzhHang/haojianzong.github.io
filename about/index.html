  <h2 class="text-center jz_color">About Me</h2>
  <p>I am an iOS developer and web developer, I live and work in
  Shenzhen/Hongkong,
  China. I enjoy building things. Therefore I learn to code and build websites
  and mobile applications, which feels like creating things from nothing.</p>

  <p>On this site I share my works and thoughts with you. I will also repost
  my posts/answers on Quora, Zhihu and StackOverflow, as long as they are
  worth sharing. By the way, I prefer to blogging in English, but I also write
  Chinese blog posts randomly.</p>
